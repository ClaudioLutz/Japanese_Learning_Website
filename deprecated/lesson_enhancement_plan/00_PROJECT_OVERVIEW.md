# Japanese Learning Website - Lesson Enhancement Project

## Project Goal
Enhance the existing lesson system to allow admins to create comprehensive lessons with multiple sub-lessons (content items) of various types including videos, information slides, multiple choice questions, audio files, and more.

## Current State
- ✅ Basic lesson CRUD operations
- ✅ Database models for lessons and content
- ✅ User lesson viewing and progress tracking
- ✅ API endpoints for lesson management
- ❌ **Missing**: Comprehensive content creation interface
- ❌ **Missing**: File upload system for multimedia
- ❌ **Missing**: Interactive content types (quizzes, slides)
- ❌ **Missing**: Rich content editing capabilities

## Implementation Approach
**Phased Development**: Each phase will be implemented and tested before moving to the next phase.

## Phase Structure

### Phase 1: Enhanced Content Builder Foundation
**Duration**: 1-2 days
**Goal**: Create a robust content addition interface that allows admins to easily add various types of sub-lessons to a lesson.

### Phase 2: File Upload System
**Duration**: 1-2 days  
**Goal**: Implement secure local file upload for images, videos, and audio files.

### Phase 3: Rich Text Content
**Duration**: 1 day
**Goal**: Add rich text editing capabilities for information slides and text content.

### Phase 4: Interactive Content Types
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Goal**: Implement multiple choice questions, fill-in-the-blank, and other interactive elements.

### Phase 5: Content Organization & Management
**Duration**: 1-2 days
**Goal**: Add drag-and-drop reordering, content preview, and advanced management features.

### Phase 6: Prerequisites & Publishing Workflow
**Duration**: 1-2 days
**Goal**: Complete the lesson creation workflow with prerequisites management and publishing controls.

## Success Criteria
- Admin can create lessons with unlimited sub-lessons
- Support for all requested content types (video, slides, multiple choice, audio, etc.)
- Intuitive and user-friendly interface
- Secure file handling
- Proper content organization and management
- Complete lesson creation workflow from start to finish

## Testing Strategy
After each phase:
1. Functional testing of new features
2. Integration testing with existing system
3. User experience validation
4. Performance and security checks
5. Documentation updates

## Technical Considerations
- **File Storage**: Local storage with organized directory structure
- **Security**: File type validation, size limits, secure upload handling
- **Performance**: Efficient file serving, optimized database queries
- **Scalability**: Modular design for future enhancements
- **Maintainability**: Clean code structure, proper documentation
