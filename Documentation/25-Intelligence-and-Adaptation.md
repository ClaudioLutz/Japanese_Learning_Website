## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

```
User Performance Data → Performance Analyzer → Weakness Analysis
                                                      ↓
Content Database ← Personalized Lesson Generator ← Remediation Suggestions
                                                      ↓
Generated Lesson → Content Validator → Validation Results → Improvements
```

### Integration Points

1. **Database Integration**: All components integrate with existing SQLAlchemy models
2. **AI Services**: Leverages existing `AILessonContentGenerator` for content creation
3. **User Progress**: Builds on existing `UserLessonProgress` and `UserQuizAnswer` models
4. **Content Management**: Creates lessons using existing `Lesson` and `LessonContent` models

## Key Algorithms

### Performance Scoring Algorithm

```python
def calculate_overall_score():
    quiz_score = (correct_answers / total_answers) * 40  # 40% weight
    completion_score = (avg_completion_rate / 100) * 40  # 40% weight
    consistency_score = activity_bonus * 20  # 20% weight
    return quiz_score + completion_score + consistency_score
```

### Adaptive Difficulty Adjustment

```python
def adjust_difficulty(performance_score):
    if performance_score < 40:
        return "decrease"  # Easier content
    elif performance_score > 85:
        return "increase"  # Harder content
    else:
        return "maintain"  # Current level appropriate
```

### Content Prioritization

```python
def prioritize_weaknesses(analysis):
    priority_areas = []
    for area, stats in analysis.items():
        if stats['accuracy'] < 70 or stats['attempts'] > 2:
            severity = "high" if stats['accuracy'] < 50 else "medium"
            priority_areas.append({'area': area, 'severity': severity})
    return sorted(priority_areas, key=lambda x: severity_order[x['severity']])
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Analyzing User Performance

```python
from app.user_performance_analyzer import UserPerformanceAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzer for specific user
analyzer = UserPerformanceAnalyzer(user_id=123)

# Get comprehensive analysis
analysis = analyzer.analyze_weaknesses()

print(f"Overall Score: {analysis['overall_score']}%")
print(f"Weak Areas: {[k for k, v in analysis['content_type_weaknesses'].items() if v['is_weakness']]}")
```

### 2. Generating Personalized Content

```python
from app.personalized_lesson_generator import PersonalizedLessonGenerator

# Initialize generator
generator = PersonalizedLessonGenerator(user_id=123)

# Generate remedial lesson for weak areas
remedial_lesson = generator.generate_personalized_lesson("remedial")

# Create 4-week study plan
study_plan = generator.generate_study_plan(weeks=4)

print(f"Created lesson: {remedial_lesson['lesson_data']['title']}")
print(f"Study plan goals: {study_plan['overall_goals']}")
```

### 3. Validating Content Quality

```python
from app.content_validator import ContentValidator

# Initialize validator
validator = ContentValidator()

# Validate lesson content
validation = validator.validate_lesson(lesson_id=456)

print(f"Validation Score: {validation['overall_score']}/100")
print(f"Issues Found: {len(validation['issues_found'])}")

# Get improvement suggestions
improvements = validator.generate_improvement_suggestions(validation)
print(f"Priority Improvements: {len(improvements['priority_improvements'])}")
```

- `Kanji`, `Vocabulary`, `Grammar` for content selection

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation

```python
try:
    analysis = analyzer.analyze_weaknesses()
except Exception as e:
    # Fallback to basic analysis
    analysis = create_default_analysis(user_id)
    logger.warning(f"Performance analysis failed, using defaults: {e}")
```

### Validation Fallbacks

```python
try:
    validation = validator.validate_lesson(lesson_id)
except Exception as e:
    # Continue with basic validation
    validation = {'overall_score': 75, 'issues_found': [], 'recommendations': []}
    logger.error(f"AI validation failed: {e}")
```

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- User performance data is anonymized in logs
- Personal information is never sent to external AI services
- Analysis results are stored securely with proper access controls

### AI Safety
- Content validation includes cultural sensitivity checks
- Generated content is filtered for appropriateness
- Human oversight recommended for sensitive content

### Rate Limiting
- AI API calls are rate-limited to prevent abuse
- Caching implemented to reduce API usage
- Fallback mechanisms for API failures

   - Check database connectivity
   - Verify user has quiz answers recorded

2. **Content Generation Fails**
   - Verify OpenAI API key is valid
   - Check API rate limits
   - Ensure sufficient database content exists

3. **Validation Scores Are Low**
   - Review content for accuracy
   - Check cultural appropriateness
   - Verify educational objectives are clear

### Debug Commands

```python
# Enable debug logging
import logging
logging.getLogger('app.user_performance_analyzer').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Test API connectivity
from app.ai_services import AILessonContentGenerator
generator = AILessonContentGenerator()
test_result = generator.generate_explanation("test", "beginner", "debug")
```
