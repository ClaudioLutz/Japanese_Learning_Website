This script creates a comprehensive The Japanese Music Scene: From J-Pop to Enka lesson organized into pages.
Each content page covers different aspects of the topic with explanations, followed by dedicated quiz pages.
The quizzes are separated from the explanatory content as requested.

FIXES APPLIED:
- Correct Python path setup for subdirectory execution
- Consolidated imports to avoid UnboundLocalError
- Proper difficulty level integer conversion
- Database field length constraints handled
- Correct .env file path resolution
- UTF-8 encoding declaration for Unicode support
