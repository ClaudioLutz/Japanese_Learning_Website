# Database Migration Summary: Complete Solution

## 📋 What You Have

I've created a complete database migration solution with the following files:

### **1. `migrate_data.py`** - Main Migration Script
- **Purpose**: Migrates all tables from SQLite (`instance/site.db`) to Google Cloud SQL PostgreSQL
- **Features**:
  - Dynamic table discovery (no hardcoded table list needed)
  - Comprehensive error handling for each table
  - Data type conversion for PostgreSQL compatibility
  - Real-time progress logging
  - Migration verification with row count comparison
  - Detailed success/failure reporting

### **2. `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`** - Complete Step-by-Step Guide
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive instructions for running the migration
- **Includes**:
  - Pre-migration checklist
  - Exact terminal commands sequence
  - Expected output examples
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Post-migration verification steps

### **3. `test_migration_setup.py`** - Pre-Migration Validation
- **Purpose**: Test all prerequisites before running the actual migration
- **Validates**:
  - Environment variables (DB_PASSWORD)
  - Python dependencies
  - SQLite database connection and table discovery
  - PostgreSQL connection via Cloud SQL Auth Proxy
  - Table structure comparison between databases

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

Here's the exact sequence to run on your VM:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install pandas sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary google-auth-oauthlib

# 2. Start Cloud SQL Auth Proxy (for your specific project)
./cloud_sql_proxy -instances=gen-lang-client-0648546045:europe-west6:japanese-learning-db=tcp:5432 &

# 3. Set database password
export DB_PASSWORD="your_actual_password"

# 4. Test setup (recommended)
python test_migration_setup.py

# 5. Run migration
python migrate_data.py
```

## 🔍 Key Features of the Solution

### **Smart Table Discovery**
- Automatically finds all user tables in SQLite
- Excludes system tables (`sqlite_%`, `alembic_%`)
- No need to maintain a hardcoded table list

### **Robust Error Handling**
- Each table migration is wrapped in try/catch
- One failed table won't stop the entire migration
- Detailed error logging for troubleshooting

### **Data Type Compatibility**
- Handles SQLite to PostgreSQL data type conversions
- Special handling for datetime and boolean fields
- Preserves data integrity during transfer

### **Comprehensive Logging**
- Real-time progress display
- Detailed log file with timestamps
- Final summary with success/failure statistics
- Row count verification for each table

### **Connection Management**
- Connects via Cloud SQL Auth Proxy (secure)
- Proper connection pooling and cleanup
- Connection testing before migration starts

## 📊 What the Migration Does

1. **Discovers Tables**: Queries `sqlite_master` to find all user tables
2. **For Each Table**:
   - Logs table name and column information
   - Reads entire table into pandas DataFrame
   - Applies PostgreSQL compatibility transformations
   - Writes data to PostgreSQL using `if_exists='append'`
   - Verifies migration by comparing row counts
   - Logs success/failure with details

3. **Final Report**: Shows complete statistics and detailed results

---

## 🛡️ Security & Best Practices

- **Environment Variables**: Password stored securely in `DB_PASSWORD`
- **Connection Security**: Uses Cloud SQL Auth Proxy for secure connections
- **Error Isolation**: Failed tables don't affect others
- **Data Verification**: Row count validation after each table
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Full audit trail of migration process

---

## 📝 Important Notes

### **Database Requirements**
- PostgreSQL database (`japanese_learning`) must exist
- **Tables are created automatically** based on SQLite schema
- User `app_user` needs `CREATE`, `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` permissions
- Existing tables with same names will be dropped and recreated

### **Instance Connection Name**
Find your instance connection name in:
- Google Cloud Console → SQL → Your Instance → Overview → Connection name
- Format: `PROJECT_ID:REGION:INSTANCE_NAME`
- Example: `my-project:us-central1:japanese-learning-db`

### **Migration Strategy**
- **Automatically drops and recreates each table** to ensure clean and complete data transfer
- Processes tables in alphabetical order
- Uses chunked inserts (1000 rows per batch) for efficiency
- Includes small delays between tables to avoid overwhelming the database

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "DB_PASSWORD not set" | `export DB_PASSWORD="your_password"` |
| "Connection refused" | Check if Cloud SQL Auth Proxy is running |
| "No tables found" | Verify `instance/site.db` exists and is readable |
| "Permission denied" | Check `app_user` has CREATE, INSERT, etc. permissions |
| "Table creation failed" | Review log file for specific schema conversion errors |

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

The migration is successful when:
- All tables are discovered and processed
- Row counts match between SQLite and PostgreSQL
- No error messages in the final report
- Log file shows "🎉 All tables migrated successfully!"

---

## 📞 Next Steps After Migration

1. **Configure Production Environment**: Set `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
2. **Verify Data**: Run spot checks on critical data
3. **Test Application**: Ensure all app features work with PostgreSQL
4. **Create Backup**: Backup the migrated PostgreSQL database
5. **Monitor Performance**: Watch for any performance issues

### **Quick Production Setup:**
```bash
# Set database URL for production
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://app_user:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/japanese_learning"

# Make it persistent
echo 'export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://app_user:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/japanese_learning"' >> ~/.bashrc

# Start your Flask app (it will automatically use PostgreSQL)
python run.py
```

**See `PRODUCTION_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.**
