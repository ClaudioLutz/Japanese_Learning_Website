# Initial Payment Integration Plan
## PostFinance Checkout Integration for Japanese Learning Website

### Project Overview
This document outlines the initial plan for integrating PostFinance Checkout payment services into the Japanese Learning Website platform. The integration will replace the current MVP mock payment system with a fully functional payment processing solution.

### Current State Analysis

#### Existing Payment Infrastructure
- **Mock Payment System**: Currently implemented as MVP with instant purchase records
- **Database Models**: Already prepared for real payment integration
  - `LessonPurchase` model with `stripe_payment_intent_id` field (can be repurposed)
  - `CoursePurchase` model with payment intent tracking
  - Pricing fields in `Lesson` and `Course` models
- **API Endpoints**: Basic purchase endpoints exist but use mock processing
- **User Management**: Authentication and authorization systems in place
- **Revenue Tracking**: Admin interfaces for monitoring sales and revenue

#### PostFinance Checkout SDK Capabilities
- **Python SDK**: Available via `pip install postfinancecheckout`
- **Authentication**: HMAC-SHA512 MAC signature required for each API call
- **Transaction Management**: Full lifecycle with states: `PENDING`, `CONFIRMED`, `PROCESSING`, `FAILED`, `AUTHORIZED`, `VOIDED`, `COMPLETED`, `FULFILL`
- **Payment Options**: Hosted payment page, iframe integration, and lightbox modes
- **Webhook Integration**: Real-time updates with payload signature verification
- **Subscription Engine**: Built-in subscription management with Products, Plans, and recurring charges
- **Configuration**: Requires `space_id` (spaceId), `user_id` (x-mac-userid), and `api_secret` (application_user_key)

## Critical Technical Recommendations (Based on PFP API Documentation Analysis)

### Priority 1: HMAC-SHA512 Authentication Implementation
**Importance**: This is the most complex part of basic API communication and must be implemented correctly from day one.

- [ ] **MAC Authentication Service**: Create dedicated method in `PostFinanceService` for HMAC-SHA512 request signing
- [ ] **Reference Implementation**: Use PHP, Java, and Python examples provided in PFP documentation as guide
- [ ] **Request Signing Process**: Implement concatenated string creation of request details + HMAC-SHA512 algorithm
- [ ] **Header Management**: Ensure `x-mac-userid` and `application_user_key` are properly included in all API calls
- [ ] **Testing**: Create comprehensive tests for MAC signature generation and validation

### Priority 2: Metadata Strategy for Data Linking
**Importance**: Clean way to link PFP transactions back to application data models.

- [ ] **Transaction Metadata**: Use `metaData` field on Transaction object to store internal IDs (lesson_id, course_id)
- [ ] **Data Integrity**: Avoid repurposing other fields - metadata is explicitly designed for this purpose
- [ ] **Retrieval Logic**: Implement metadata parsing in webhook and status check endpoints
- [ ] **Validation**: Ensure metadata is preserved through entire transaction lifecycle

### Priority 3: Webhook Listener Configuration
**Importance**: Proper webhook setup is critical for real-time payment processing.

- [ ] **Entity Specification**: Configure listeners specifically for `Transaction` entity
- [ ] **State Filtering**: Monitor specific final states: `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, `FULFILL` initially
- [ ] **Listener Settings**: Configure `identity` and `enablePayloadSignatureAndState` flags correctly
- [ ] **Public Key Retrieval**: Implement `Webhook Encryption Service` integration for signature verification
- [ ] **Gradual Expansion**: Start with essential states, then add refund/chargeback listeners later

### Priority 4: Error Handling Architecture
**Importance**: PFP provides detailed error models that should be properly utilized.

- [ ] **Client Error Handling**: Parse and handle `Client Error` response model appropriately
- [ ] **Server Error Handling**: Implement proper `Server Error` response model processing
- [ ] **User Feedback**: Create meaningful error messages from PFP error responses
- [ ] **Logging Strategy**: Log detailed error information for debugging and monitoring
- [ ] **Retry Logic**: Implement appropriate retry mechanisms for transient errors

### Priority 5: Line Item Architecture
**Importance**: Proper line item structure for accurate transaction representation.

- [ ] **Complete Line Items**: Use all Line Item model fields: `name`, `quantity`, `uniqueId`, `unitPriceIncludingTax`, `sku`
- [ ] **Item Types**: Properly utilize `type` field for PRODUCT and DISCOUNT line items
- [ ] **Discount Strategy**: Implement discounts as separate line items of type `DISCOUNT`
- [ ] **Currency Consistency**: Ensure all line items match transaction currency (CHF)
- [ ] **SKU Management**: Implement proper SKU generation for lessons and courses

## Technical Architecture Considerations

### Database Schema Changes
```sql
-- Add new fields to existing tables
ALTER TABLE lesson_purchase ADD COLUMN postfinance_transaction_id VARCHAR(100);
ALTER TABLE lesson_purchase ADD COLUMN transaction_state VARCHAR(50);
ALTER TABLE course_purchase ADD COLUMN postfinance_transaction_id VARCHAR(100);
ALTER TABLE course_purchase ADD COLUMN transaction_state VARCHAR(50);

-- New table for detailed transaction logging
CREATE TABLE payment_transaction (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    transaction_id VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES user(id),
    item_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- 'lesson' or 'course'
    item_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    currency VARCHAR(3) DEFAULT 'CHF',
    state VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    webhook_data JSONB
);
```

### Configuration Structure
```python
class PaymentConfig:
    POSTFINANCE_SPACE_ID = os.environ.get('POSTFINANCE_SPACE_ID')
    POSTFINANCE_USER_ID = os.environ.get('POSTFINANCE_USER_ID')
    POSTFINANCE_API_SECRET = os.environ.get('POSTFINANCE_API_SECRET')
    PAYMENT_SUCCESS_URL = os.environ.get('PAYMENT_SUCCESS_URL')
    PAYMENT_FAILURE_URL = os.environ.get('PAYMENT_FAILURE_URL')
    WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_SECRET = os.environ.get('WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_SECRET')
```

### Service Layer Architecture
```python
class PostFinanceService:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.client = self._initialize_client()
    
    def create_lesson_transaction(self, user, lesson):
        """Create transaction for lesson purchase"""
        
    def create_course_transaction(self, user, course):
        """Create transaction for course purchase"""
        
    def generate_payment_url(self, transaction_id):
        """Generate payment page URL"""
        
    def verify_webhook_signature(self, payload, signature):
        """Verify webhook signature for security"""
        
    def process_webhook_event(self, event_data):
        """Process webhook payment status updates"""
```
