1Introduction

This document explains common aspects of all the REST services. Use the index on the right side to quickly navigate through the chapters. An overview over and introduction to the Rest services can be found in the general documentation.
1.1Type System

The REST service is based up on the following basic types. They are considered as primitives.

Long
	

A long is a number consisting only of digits. It is has a size of 64 bit.

Integer
	

An integer is a number consisting only of digits. It is has a size of 32 bit.

String
	

A string consists of digits or chars. The size is not limited by definition. However the parameters and properties may specify explicitly a size.

Boolean
	

A boolean holds either true or false.

Decimal
	

A decimal is floating point number. We typically have 19 digits and 8 decimal places.

Date
	

A date defines a specific day. We represent dates as strings since JSON does not provide a standard way to represent dates. We format the dates according to ISO 8601 (e.g. 2012-04-23). A date will not contain a time zone. If it is relevant to attach a time to the corresponding date we use UTC for this purpose. If you are in doubts how to convert to a date use UTC.

DateTime
	

A date defines a specific point in time. We represent dates as strings since JSON does not provide a standard way to represent dates. We format the dates according to ISO 8601 (e.g. 2012-04-23T18:25:43.511[Europe/Berlin]). When no time zone is provided we will use the time zone based on the current acting user or UTC. We strongly recommend always providing a time zone.

Duration
	

A duration defines a time span between to time points (e.g. one month). A duration is represented as a String in the duration format of ISO 8601 (e.g. P1M).

Complex Object
	

A complex object consists of a set of properties. Each property can have again a primitive type, a complex object or a collection.

Collection
	

A collection is a list of either primitives or a list of complex objects. A collection consists always of the same type. We do not mix types within a collection.

Binary
	

A binary contains data in a arbitrary format. The corresponding format is indicated along the type (e.g. text/csv)
1.2Object Versioning / Locking

The API returns objects and allows to update those objects. This may lead to race conditions when the same object is modified by multiple users or processes at the same time. Each potentially affected object contains a property version. This version is incremented whenever a change on it is applied. Before an update is applied on the object the version is verified to be still the same. If this check fails the update fails. This version number is also updated when a change is applied through the user interface. As a consequence to update a particular object the version property has to be passed. This concept is also known as optimistic locking.

The failure of an update should be handled depending on the context. Generally there are two options:

    If a user was the trigger for the update let the user apply the update again. The latest version should be fetched and presented to the user to update the object again.

    If an automated process is the trigger of the update the update should be wrapped within a loop which retries on a failure to update the object multiple times.

When a request leads to a conflict we return a 409 HTTP status.
1.3Entity Search

For most entities there is a search operation. The search allows to fetch only particular entities. Means the returned entities are filtered by a query. The query is structured similar to a SQL query. Essentially there is a part which limits the result and there is a paging mechanism. The model definition Entity Query defines the whole query.

The filter object allows to formulate the restrictions. The expression is similar to the WHERE part in an SQL statement. It is a recursive data structure which allows to define AND and OR groups. Each group can have multiple restrictions on properties. The fieldName can reference a property or it can be a path to a property. As an example to get all application users which are linked with the account test the following query can be used:

{
	'filter': {
		'fieldName': 'primaryAccount.name',
		'operator': 'EQUALS',
		'type': 'LEAF',
		'value': 'test'
	}
}

Beside the restriction given through the filter the query can also order the results by a fieldName. As the fieldName of the filter the fieldName of the orderBys can use the dot notation to order by a foreign property.

The paging can be realized by indicating the startingEntity and the numberOfEntities. The startingEntity indicates the entity with which the result should start. The numberOfEntities controls how many results should be returned. The get the total count for a particular filter the count operation can be used.

There are some limitation regarding the fields which can be used to filter results. Not all fields can be used for filtering and sorting. The fields which are marked as virtual cannot be used for filtering and ordering. Additionally if the relationship between entities are implemented with a reference consisting of a long the relationship cannot be used for ordering and filtering.

Some properties may be language aware. As such the filtering and ordering will impact the result. As such it is recommended to provide a language to make sure that the right results are returned. If no language is provided either the default language (en-US) is used or the language we may detect within the HTTP request.
1.4Machine-readable API Definition / Swagger

The description of the API in this document is intended to be used when the API is integrated without using a software development kit (SDK) and it is intended to be used as a reference to understand each single service.

To simplify the integration we provide the API definition also in a machine readable format. The service description is written in Swagger. It can be found under Swagger. The Swagger documentation may provide more details about how to use the provided JSON file.

Swagger uses tags to group operations together and each operation is uniquely identified by an operationId. The Swagger specification is not strict enough to generate meaningful client code. As such we introduce the following conventions:

    Each operation will be tagged exactly with one tag. This tag correspond to the service name. It is always in camel case.

    Each operationId starts with the operation tag followed by a underscore (_) and an operation name. This operation name is unique per service. Means each tag will contain exactly one such operation name and not more. This operation name is also in camel case.

We recommend to create a class per service (tag) and each such service class can hold all operations of this particular tag. The operation name can be used as the method name of the operation within the class. Client languages which are not object oriented may use the whole operationId as the identifier. We ensure that the operationId is stable over time.
1.5SDK

We provide software development kits (SDK) for several programming languages. Those SDK reduce your effort to integrate our services. All available SDKs including documentation can be accessed via our Github Repository.
1.6Meta Data

There are objects which contain meta data. Meta data properties allow to store arbitrary data along the object. The data provided is not changed or touched by our system. However it can be accessed as any other property of the object. The data can be accessed over the web service API, but also within templates etc. The meta data property is a key / value store.

There are some limits what can be stored and how it can be stored:

    Per object no more than 25 key / value pairs can be provided.

    A key cannot be longer as 40 chars.

    A value cannot be longer as 512 chars.

    The key can only contain alphabetic chars, numeric chars and underscores. The key cannot starts with an underscore or a number. The regex against we validate the key is: [a-zA-Z]{1}[a-zA-Z0-9_]{0,39}

    The value can contain any printable UTF-8 char including line breaks. However stop chars etc. are not permitted. The value can also contain HTML tags.

2Authentication

In order to use the REST services you will have to properly authenticate in the web service API. In order to authenticate a request we use a MAC authentication algorithm. How this authentication algorithm has to be implemented - in case you do not use our libraries - is described in details here.
2.1Basics

The MAC authentication requires four custom HTTP headers to be sent with each request:

    x-mac-version: To indicate the algorithm version. For the current this will always be the single digit 1.

    x-mac-userid: The user ID (an unsigned integer) formatted as a decimal number.

    x-mac-timestamp: The time formated as unix timestamp.

    x-mac-value: The actual MAC value (a 64 byte value calculated as explained below) encoded in Base64 (with padding, using the standard alphabet) as defined in section 4 of RFC 4648.

Splitting the Base64 string into whitespace separated chunks is accepted but not recommended.

Below you will find an example for the generation of a MAC value with example inputs including examples in some programming languages as guidelines.
2.2Getting the User ID and Authentication Key

To get the x-mac-userid you will first have to create an application user in your account. In order to do this navigate to Account > Users > Application Users and create your application user.

Once an application user is created you will see its ID in the corresponding column of the application user list. This value should be used for the x-mac-userid. In the image below it would be the userid 4.
Example Userid
Figure 1. Navigate to Account > Users > Application Users and get the userid. In this example it is the number 4.
When you create a new user you will be displayed an application_user_key. This key represents the 32 byte authentication key encoded with Base-64. You should write that key down as it is used to sign the requests. For security reasons, the key will not be shown again! In case you loose the key, you will not be able to continue using that key. However you can create at any time a new key and deactivate the old one. The number of active keys a user can have is limited.
2.3Calculating the Time Stamp

The x-mac-timestamp is an unsigned integer (formatted as a decimal number) representing the number of seconds since midnight 1970‑01‑01. (See also UNIX Time Stamp in Wikipedia.)

The time in the request is needed to prevent relay attacks. In order to use the API you have to make sure that your server has set an accurate system time. We do currently allow a maximum of 600 seconds difference between our server time and your calculated time stamp.

The following example code demonstrates how to generated a time stamp using PHP:

<?php
// Assigns the current timestamp to the timestamp variable:
$timestamp = time();
?>

2.4Calculating the MAC Value

After you collected all the data you have to calculate the x-mac-value using the following input:

    Algorithm Version: The same fixed string as defined above in x-mac-version header.

    User ID: The user ID as used for the x-mac-userid header.

    Time stamp: The same string representing the current time as used for the x-mac-timestamp header.

    Method: The name of the HTTP method used for the request (as a string). This is normally one of the HTTP standard methods GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, CONNECT. Note: These values are case-sensitive; the standard methods are always uppercase.

    Path: The path component of the requested URL, including any query string (example see below).

To calculate the MAC, the strings from these items are concatenated into a single string (the authentication message) using the vertical bar |; (U+007C) as a separator.

This string is then encoded to a sequence of bytes using the UTF-8 encoding (without any byte order mark) according to RFC 3629. These bytes form the message which will be authenticated by the MAC which we generate.

Apart from the message bytes, the HMAC-SHA512 algorithm requires a secret key. In our case this is a sequence of exactly 32 bytes which you received in Base-64 encoding as the application_user_key when you created your application user (see above for more details). With this key you apply the HMAC-SHA512 algorithm to the message bytes and will receive a 64 byte MAC value as the result. This MAC value, again encoded in Base-64 code, will then be the value of x-mac-value header.

For a better understanding you will find an abstract illustration of the MAC calculation below in various programming languages.
2.5Example

In order to illustrate the above we created an example calculation with the following input values to generate an payment page displayed in an iframe. We will guide you through the implementation first a low level implementation. However, you find further down some concrete implementation in various programming languages based on the example values below.

    x-mac-version header: 1

    x-mac-userid header: 2481632

    x-mac-timestamp header: 1425387916

    Method: GET

    Path: /api/transaction/read?spaceId=12&id=1

    Authentication-Key: OWOMg2gnaSx1nukAM6SN2vxedfY1yLPONvcTKbhDv7I=

Concatenating items 1. through 5. with | as the separator we get the following string:

1|2481632|1425387916|GET|/api/transaction/read?spaceId=12&id=1

Which, encoded with UTF-8, results in our Authentication Message (shown as a sequence of 95 bytes in hex):

0x31, 0x7c, 0x32, 0x34, 0x38, 0x31, 0x36, 0x33, 0x32, 0x7c, 0x31, 0x34, 0x32, 0x35, 0x33, 0x38,
0x37, 0x39, 0x31, 0x36, 0x7c, 0x47, 0x45, 0x54, 0x7c, 0x2f, 0x61, 0x70, 0x69, 0x2f, 0x74, 0x72,
0x61, 0x6e, 0x73, 0x61, 0x63, 0x74, 0x69, 0x6f, 0x6e, 0x2f, 0x72, 0x65, 0x61, 0x64, 0x3f, 0x73,
0x70, 0x61, 0x63, 0x65, 0x49, 0x64, 0x3d, 0x31, 0x32, 0x26, 0x69, 0x64, 0x3d, 0x31

Decoding the Authentication-Key into a sequence of 32 bytes gives:

0x39, 0x63, 0x8c, 0x83, 0x68, 0x27, 0x69, 0x2c, 0x75, 0x9e, 0xe9, 0x00, 0x33, 0xa4, 0x8d, 0xda,
0xfc, 0x5e, 0x75, 0xf6, 0x35, 0xc8, 0xb3, 0xce, 0x36, 0xf7, 0x13, 0x29, 0xb8, 0x43, 0xbf, 0xb2

Now we apply the HMAC-SHA512 function with the Authentication-Key as the key and the Authentication Message as the message and get the following 64 bytes sequence as the resulting MAC value:

0xb7, 0x3e, 0xd1, 0xa9, 0x10, 0x47, 0xf0, 0x61, 0x30, 0xdb, 0xdb, 0x63, 0xdb, 0xfc, 0x7b, 0xea,
0x8a, 0x4a, 0x9a, 0x56, 0xed, 0x86, 0x40, 0x85, 0x24, 0xba, 0xa2, 0xc2, 0x42, 0x88, 0x51, 0x90,
0x4a, 0x88, 0xcd, 0x47, 0x68, 0x77, 0xa2, 0xb0, 0x2f, 0xc8, 0x43, 0x36, 0x84, 0x80, 0x20, 0xcc,
0x83, 0x40, 0x88, 0xd2, 0x4b, 0xc9, 0x74, 0xf0, 0x26, 0x6d, 0x2d, 0x75, 0xa3, 0x1c, 0xf3, 0xe1,

The above sequence encoded in Base-64 finally gives the string which should be used as the value of the x-mac-value header:

2.5.1PHP

To create an authentication in PHP use the example below as an illustration on how to create the x-mac-value.

<?php
$decodedSecret = base64_decode("OWOMg2gnaSx1nukAM6SN2vxedfY1yLPONvcTKbhDv7I=");
echo base64_encode(hash_hmac("sha512", "1|2481632|1425387916|GET|/api/transaction/read?spaceId=12&id=1", $decodedSecret, true));
?>

2.5.2Java

To create an authentication in Java use the example below as an illustration on how to create the x-mac-value.

import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.security.InvalidKeyException;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
import java.util.Base64;

import javax.crypto.Mac;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;

public class Test {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
		String securedData =
				"1|2481632|1425387916|GET|/api/transaction/read?spaceId=12&id=1";

		String secret = "OWOMg2gnaSx1nukAM6SN2vxedfY1yLPONvcTKbhDv7I=";
		byte[] decodedSecret = Base64.getDecoder().decode(secret);

		Mac mac = Mac.getInstance("HmacSHA512");
		mac.init(new SecretKeySpec(decodedSecret, "HmacSHA512"));

		byte[] bytes = mac.doFinal(securedData.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));

		System.out.println(new String(Base64.getEncoder().encode(bytes), StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
	}
}

2.5.3Python

To create an authentication in Python use the example below as an illustration on how to create the x-mac-value.

import hashlib
import hmac
import base64

def sign(secret, userId, method, path, timestamp):
    data = "1|" + str(userId) + "|"+str(timestamp)+"|" + method + "|" + path
    return hmac.new(base64.b64decode(secret), data, hashlib.sha512).digest().encode("base64").replace('\n', '')

print sign("OWOMg2gnaSx1nukAM6SN2vxedfY1yLPONvcTKbhDv7I=", "2481632", "GET", "/api/transaction/read?spaceId=12&id=1", 1425387916)

2.6MAC Calculation Illustrated

The following diagram illustrates the calculation of the complete algorithm described above:

2.7Request Logging

In some cases it helps when you can attach to each request an ID to trace the request through different systems. By adding the HTTP header x-wallee-logtoken you can send a request token which is added to our logs and we can trace it when you get in contact with us. The log token should contain a unique ID per request.
3Services

In this section all services are described. Each service is responsible for handling one particular entity.

A service consists of different operations. Each operation may accept a set of query parameter and depending on the request method a body message. The query parameter need to be append to the request URL according to the RFC 3986. The body message has to be sent within the body of the HTTP request.

Below there is a complete HTTP request for a notional service SomeService.

POST /api/SomeService/operationName?queryParameter1=valueOfQueryParameter1&queryParameter2=value2 HTTP/1.0
x-mac-version: 1
x-mac-userid: 12313
x-mac-timestamp: 1471016771
x-mac-value: (hash-calculated as described in the previous section)

{"some-property": "some-value", "other-value": 123}

The service will return a response. Depending on the response code the body may contain some JSON object. Each service states what kind of responses can be expected.

4Model Definitions

The service may return complex objects those objects are defined within this section.

Models may have references between each other. A reference means an object points to another object. Depending on the reference we serialize the referenced object directly or we only serialize the primary key (long) of the referenced object. This means depending on the use case the actual object needs to be loaded with the according service. In this case we indicate this by defining the type as a long and we provide a link to the actual model we reference.
